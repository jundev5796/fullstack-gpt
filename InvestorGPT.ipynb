      "Summary: A supply chain attack is a cyber-attack that seeks to damage an organization by targeting less secure elements in the supply chain. A supply chain attack can occur in any industry, from the financial sector, oil industry, to a government sector. A supply chain attack can happen in software or hardware. Cybercriminals typically tamper with the manufacturing or distribution of a product by installing malware or hardware-based spying components. Symantec's 2019 Internet Security Threat Report states that supply chain attacks increased by 78 percent in 2018. A supply chain is a system of activities involved in handling, distributing, manufacturing, and processing goods in order to move resources from a vendor into the hands of the final consumer. A supply chain is a complex network of interconnected players governed by supply and demand.Although supply chain attack is a broad term without a universally agreed upon definition, in reference to cyber-security, a supply chain attack involves physically tampering with electronics (computers, ATMs, power systems, factory data networks) in order to install undetectable malware for the purpose of bringing harm to a player further down the supply chain network.In a more general sense, a supply chain attack may not necessarily involve electronics. In 2010 when burglars gained access to the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly's supply warehouse, by drilling a hole in the roof and loading $80 million worth of prescription drugs into a truck, they could also have been said to carry out a supply chain attack. However, this article will discuss cyber attacks on physical supply networks that rely on technology; hence, a supply chain attack is a method used by cyber-criminals.\n",

The issue has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.[4][5][6]\\n\\n\\nBackground[edit]\\nMicrosoft employee and PostgreSQL developer Andres Freund reported the backdoor after investigating a performance regression in Debian Sid.[7] Freund noticed that SSH connections were generating an unexpectedly high amount of CPU usage as well as causing errors in Valgrind,[8] a memory debugging tool.[9] Freund reported his finding to Openwall Project\\'s open source security mailing list,[10] which brought it to the attention of various software vendors.[9] There is evidence that the attacker made efforts to obfuscate the code,[11][12] as the backdoor consists of multiple stages that act together.[13]\\nOnce the compromised version is incorporated into the operating system, it alters the behavior of OpenSSH\\'s SSH server daemon by abusing the systemd library, allowing the attacker to gain the same level of access as any authorized administrator.[13][9] According to the analysis by Red Hat, the backdoor can \"enable a malicious actor to break sshd authentication and gain unauthorized access to the entire system remotely\".[14]\\nA subsequent investigation found that the campaign to insert the backdoor into the XZ Utils project was a culmination of approximately three years of effort by a user going by the name Jia Tan and the nickname JiaT75 to gain access to a position of trust within the project. After a period of pressure on the founder and head maintainer to hand over the control of the project via apparent sock puppetry Jia Tan gained the position of co-maintainer of XZ Utils and was able to sign off on version 5.6.0, which introduced the backdoor, and version 5.6.1, which patched some anomalous behavior that can be apparent during software testing of the operating system.[9] Some of the suspected sock puppetry pseudonyms are Jigar Kumar, krygorin4545, and misoeater91. It is suspected that the names Jia Tan, as well as the supposed code author Hans Jansen (for versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1) are simply names invented by participants of the campaign. Neither have any sort of visible public presence in software development beyond the short few years of the campaign.[15][16] The backdoor was notable for its level of sophistication and for the fact that the perpetrator practiced a high level of operational security for a long period of time while working to attain a position of trust. American security researcher Dave Aitel has suggested that it fits the pattern attributable to APT29, an advanced persistent threat actor believed to be working on behalf of the Russian SVR.[17] Others[who?] have suggested that it could be any state actor or a non-state actor of considerable resources.[18]\\n\\nMechanism[edit]\\nThe malicious code is known to be in 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 releases of the XZ Utils software package. The exploit remains dormant unless a specific third-party patch of the SSH server is used. Under the right circumstances this interference could potentially enable a malicious actor to break sshd authentication and gain unauthorized access to the entire system remotely.[14] The malicious mechanism consists of two compressed test files that contain the malicious binary code. These files are available in the git repository, but remain dormant unless extracted and injected into the program.[6] The code uses the glibc IFUNC mechanism to replace an existing function in OpenSSH called RSA_public_decrypt with a malicious version. OpenSSH normally does not load liblzma, but a common third-party patch used by several Linux distributions causes it to load libsystemd, which in turn loads lzma.[6] A modified version of build-to-host.m4 was included in the release tar file uploaded on GitHub, which extracts a script that performs the actual injection into liblzma. This modified m4 file was not present in the git repository; it was only available from tar files released by the maintainer separate from git.[6] The script appears to perform the injection only when the system is being built on an x86-64 Linux system that uses glibc and GCC and is being built via dpkg or rpm.[6]\\n\\nResponse[edit]\\nRemediation[edit]\\nThe US federal agency responsible for cyber security and infrastructure, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, has issued a security advisory recommending that the affected devices should roll back to a previous uncompromised version.[19] Linux software vendors, including Red Hat, SUSE, and Debian, have mirrored the CISA advisory, and reverted the updates for the affected packages to older versions.[14][20][21] GitHub disabled the mirrors for the xz repository before subsequently restoring them.[22][23]\\nCanonical postponed the beta release of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and its flavours by a week and opted for a complete binary rebuild of all the distribution\\'s packages.[24] Although the stable version of Ubuntu was unaffected, upstream versions were. This precautionary measure was taken because Canonical could not guarantee by the original release deadline that the discovered backdoor did not affect additional packages during compilation.[25][26]\\n\\nBroader response[edit]\\nComputer scientist Alex Stamos opined that \"this could have been the most widespread and effective backdoor ever planted in any software product\", noting that had the backdoor remained undetected, it would have \"given its creators a master key to any of the hundreds of millions of computers around the world that run SSH\".[27] In addition, the incident also started a discussion regarding the viability of having critical pieces of cyberinfrastructure depend on unpaid volunteers.[28]\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ Digest Finance. 29 (1). 28 March 2024. doi:10.24891/df.29.1.
